## About

This is a data science project using the Yahoo Finance AAPL Stock Price data from 2015 to 2019, and is best viewed using JupyterNotebook or VisualStudioCode our plotly charts are unable to render via github's online notebook view.

## Problem Definition

Build a machine learning model to classify buy and sell signals for AAPL stock using technical indicator data on SMA, EMA, MACD and RSI.

## Models Used

- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
- **Logistic Regression**

## Conclusion

- LogisticRegression was the best out of the 4 models to classify buy and sell signals based on provided technical indicators.
- LogisticRegression had a very high prediction accuracy of 0.956, which demonstrates its effective prediction ability.
- Tree-based models have been demonstrated to be more prone to overfitting.
